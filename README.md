# Angular 7 Project Api configuration information.
 
This Project has dependency on https://github.com/JayantSingh97/MicrosoftUnityDependencyInjectionApi So Please download Api From https://github.com/JayantSingh97/MicrosoftUnityDependencyInjectionApi and just need to run the api in Microsoft visual studio latest version.

This project is already configured with https://github.com/JayantSingh97/MicrosoftUnityDependencyInjectionApi APi.

 # Angular 7 Project Configuartion information.

1- If you are facing any compilation issue then simply run the following command in your command prompt under your AngularApplication directory.

npm i

After executing the 'npm i' simply build the application and retry.

Because for performance resion Github ignores the node_modules folder because it contains large amount of storage.

npm i command creates new node_modules and restores all the project dependency.

Make sure the Angular.js application should be using the same (# PORT NUMBER ) like http://yourApisubdomain.yourApimaindomain(or)yourportnumber on which your web api is running if  there will be any kind of mismatch in api (URL || URI) configuration then application many not work appropriately.

Or it may throw unexpectedlly 404 Not Found error because your website is trying to access the Api which does not exist.
