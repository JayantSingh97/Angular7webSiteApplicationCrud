 # Angular 7 Project Configuartion information.

1- If you are facing any compilation issue then simply run the following command in your command prompt under your AngularApplication directory.

npm i

After executing the 'npm i' simply build the application and retry.

Because for performance resion Github ignores the node_modules folder because it contains large amount of storage.

npm i command creates new node_modules and restores all the project dependency.
